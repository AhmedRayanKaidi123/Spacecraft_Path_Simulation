# Spacecraft Path Simulation Web Application

## Overview
This web application simulates the path of a spacecraft from Earth to Mars (possibly more planets), demonstrating the process of finding a launch window, entering a Hohmann transfer orbit, and reaching Mars. It is designed for educational purposes, particularly for workshops and programs targeting beginners and school students.

## Features
- **Launch Window Simulation:** Demonstrates how a spacecraft finds the optimal launch window from Earth.
- **Hohmann Transfer Orbit:** Simulates the transition of the spacecraft into a Hohmann transfer orbit.
- **Mars Landing:** Shows the final approach and landing process on Mars.
- **Interactive UI:** Provides an engaging and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and learning.

## Installation
